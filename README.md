Simple static website that tells if you this week's episode of Kill la Kill has been subbed by Underwater.

Checks the Underwater RSS feed for anything named Kill la Kill uploaded since last Monday.

Easily adaptable to any feed: just swap out the url (and image urls) and maybe the date logic and BOOM

TODO:

- add link to github
