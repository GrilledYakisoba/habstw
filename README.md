Simple static website that tells if you this week's episode of Kill la Kill has been subbed and released.

Checks the HorribleSubs and Underwater RSS feed for anything named Kill la Kill uploaded since last Monday. If it detects something, it will display a message and provide related links.

It also plays music for some reason?!?

TODO:

- beg someone to make a transparent catsuki.png
  - then come up with something to do w/ it
- auto refresh feeds every minute
  - indicate w/ small bobbing ryuuko loading icon in corner
  - doesnt reload page, only changes content when changes detected
