Simple static website that tells if you this week's episode of Kill la Kill has been subbed by Underwater.

Checks the Underwater RSS feed for anything named Kill la Kill uploaded since last Monday.

Easily adaptable to any feed: just swap out the url (and image urls) and maybe the date logic and BOOM

TODO:

- work out kinks in music. might be too demanding on resources right now :/
  - re-encode songs to way lower bitrate?
- add favicon (mako face from YES)
- auto refresh feeds every minute
  - indicate w/ small bobbing ryuuko loading icon in corner
  - doesnt reload page, only changes content when changes detected
